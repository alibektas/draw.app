# OptimaDrawApp

This applet aims to provide user enough tools to model a warehouse. We currently support simple objects such as racks, rows, corridors. To assign a address to a rack
a `AddressingSphere` must be used and it must parent the object to be addressed. After the modelling is completed you can export your model which results in the output of a `JSON` file.
